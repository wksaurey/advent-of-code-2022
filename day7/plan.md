# Converting Henrichsen code to basic steps (to avoid plagerizm)
## Tips
```
use constants for the list index (NAME, PARENT, CHILDREN, SIZE)

why have nodes?
	run through each node and check size at the end, no purpose in using a binary search when you can just double it as a node?
```

## Basic Processing Steps
```
set constants and globals (root, current, nodes)

commands
	cd
		change current file
	ls
		
output
	dir
		check if dir already exists?
		create new dir
	file
		create new file
		add file size up through node tree?

```

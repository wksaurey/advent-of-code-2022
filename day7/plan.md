# Converting Henrichsen code to basic steps (to avoid plagerizm)
## Tips
```
use constants for the list index (NAME, PARENT, CHILDREN, SIZE)

why have nodes?
	run through each node and check size at the end, no purpose in using a binary search when you can just double it as a node?
```

## Basic Processing Steps
```
set constants and globals (root, current, nodes)

for line in file
	if command
		
```
